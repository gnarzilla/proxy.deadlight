### Overview

`proxy.deadlight` is a high-performance, protocol-agnostic network proxy written in C. It serves as the essential Protocol Bridge for the Deadlight Ecosystem, connecting the modern, HTTP-only world of serverless platforms like Cloudflare Workers to the foundational TCP protocols of the internet like SMTP, IMAP, and SOCKS.

Its purpose is to be a lightweight, secure, and highly portable service that can run on minimal hardware (from a small VPS to a Raspberry Pi), enabling true self-sovereignty for services like email and private communications.

### Features (Current Status)

After a comprehensive refactoring and development cycle, `proxy.deadlight` has evolved from a simple proxy into a robust, extensible framework.

- üì¶ **Modular, Protocol-Agnostic Architecture:** Built around a `DeadlightProtocolHandler` interface that allows new protocols to be added easily as self-contained modules.
- üöÄ **High-Performance C Foundation:** Utilizes the robust and efficient GNU/GLib ecosystem for high-throughput, low-latency network I/O and multi-threaded connection handling.
- üîí **Secure Tunneling & Interception:**
   - **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy:** Functions as a standard forward proxy for web traffic.
   - **SSL (TLS) Interception:** Capable of generating certificates on-the-fly for traffic inspection (MitM), a powerful tool for development and security analysis.
   - **IMAPS Tunneling:** Securely tunnels IMAP traffic over TLS, with robust certificate validation against the system's trust store.
üåê **SOCKS4 Proxy Support:** Provides basic IP masking and privacy by serving as a SOCKS4 proxy for compatible applications.
üîß **File-Based Configuration:** All core settings, listeners, and protocol behaviors are controlled via a simple .ini-style configuration file.

### Architecture

Deadlight is built on a modular design managed by a central `DeadlightContext`. A connection flows through the system as follows:
1.  The **Main Thread** runs a `GSocketService`, accepting new connections.
2.  Incoming connections are passed to a **Worker Thread** from a `GThreadPool`.
3.  The worker thread performs **Protocol Detection** by peeking at the initial bytes of the connection.
4.  The appropriate registered `DeadlightProtocolHandler` is invoked to handle the connection.
5.  The handler processes the request. It can either complete the request synchronously or, for long-lived tunnels, hand off control to **asynchronous I/O watchers** on its own thread's event loop. This prevents the worker thread from blocking.

This is all managed by a set of distinct managers:
-   **Network Manager**: Handles listener sockets, the worker pool, and connection state.
-   **SSL Manager**: Manages OpenSSL contexts, CA certificates, and performs SSL interception.
-   **Protocol System**: Manages the registration and detection of protocol handlers.
-   **Configuration Manager**: Parses INI-style configuration files.
-   **Connection Pool**: Manages and reuses upstream server connections.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

-   A C99 compliant compiler (GCC or Clang)
-   `make`
-   `pkg-config`
-   GLib 2.0+ & GIO development libraries (`libglib2.0-dev`)
-   OpenSSL 1.1.1+ development libraries (`libssl-dev`)

On Debian/Ubuntu, install all prerequisites with:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libglib2.0-dev libssl-dev glib-networking
```
- `build-essential`: Provides gcc, make, etc.
- `libglib2.0-dev`: The GLib core libraries and development headers.
- `libopenssl-dev`: For all cryptographic and TLS functions.
- `glib-networking`: The essential backend for GIO's TLS functionality.

#### Building

Clone the repository and use the provided Makefile:
```bash
git clone https://your-repo-url/deadlight.git
cd deadlight
make
```
The executable will be located at `bin/deadlight`.

#### Configuration

The proxy uses an INI-style configuration file. A sample is provided at `deadlight.conf.example`.

```ini
[core]
port = 8080
bind_address = 0.0.0.0
max_connections = 500
log_level = info
worker_threads = 4

[ssl]
enabled = true
ca_cert_file = /home/thatch/.deadlight/ca.crt
ca_key_file = /home/thatch/.deadlight/ca.key
cert_cache_dir = /tmp/deadlight_certs

[protocols]
http_enabled = true
https_enabled = true
connect_enabled = true

[plugins]
enabled = false

[imap]
# The upstream IMAP server to proxy connections to.
upstream_host = imap.gmail.com
upstream_port = 143

[imaps]
# The upstream IMAPS server to proxy connections to.
# This uses SSL/TLS on port 993.
upstream_host = imap.gmail.com
upstream_port = 993

```

#### Running
```bash
./bin/deadlight -c deadlight.conf.example
```

### Usage

#### Example 1: HTTP/HTTPS Web Proxy

Configure your browser or system to use `http:/localhost:8080` as its proxy. Or, use `curl`:

```bash
# Proxy a standard HTTP request
curl -x http://localhost:8080 http://example.com

# Proxy an HTTPS request (using the CONNECT method)
curl -x http://localhost:8080 https://example.com
```
#### Example 2: SOCKS4 Privacy Proxy

Use `curl` to route a request through the SOCKS4 handler:
```bash
curl --socks4 localhost:8080 http://example.com
```

#### Example 3: IMAPS Secure Tunnel

Test the secure IMAP tunnel using `telnet` (this proves the TLS handshake and tunneling):
```bash
telnet localhost 8080
```
Once connected, type the following and press Enter:
```text
a001 NOOP
```
The proxy will establish a secure TLS connection to the upstream IMAP server and tunnel the data.



#### Command Line Options

-   `-c, --config FILE`: Path to configuration file.
-   `-p, --port PORT`: Port to listen on (overrides config).
-   `-d, --daemon`: Run as a background daemon.
-   `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose (debug) logging.
-   `-h, --help`: Show help message.

#### Proxying HTTP
```bash
curl -x http://localhost:8080 http://example.com
```

#### Proxying & Intercepting HTTPS
For TLS interception to work, you must instruct your client to trust the proxy's Certificate Authority. The CA certificate is generated automatically (e.g., in `ssl/ca.crt`).

```bash
# The --cacert flag tells curl to trust our custom CA for this one request.
curl --cacert ssl/ca.crt -x http://localhost:8080 https://example.com
```

### Extending Deadlight

#### Adding a New Protocol
The core strength of Deadlight is its extensible protocol system. To add support for a new protocol:
1.  Create `my_protocol.c` and `my_protocol.h` in the `src/protocols/` directory.
2.  Implement the `DeadlightProtocolHandler` interface:
    *   `detect`: A function that inspects a buffer and returns a non-zero value if it matches the protocol.
    *   `handle`: The main function to process the connection. It **must** return a `DeadlightHandlerResult` to correctly manage the connection's lifecycle (`HANDLER_SUCCESS_CLEANUP_NOW` for synchronous tasks, `HANDLER_SUCCESS_ASYNC` for asynchronous tasks).
    *   `cleanup`: An optional function for any protocol-specific cleanup.
3.  Create a public registration function, e.g., `deadlight_register_my_protocol_handler()`.
4.  Call your registration function from `deadlight_protocols_init()` in `src/core/protocols.c`.
5.  Add `src/protocols/my_protocol.c` to the `PROTOCOL_SOURCES` list in the `Makefile`.
6.  Recompile. Your protocol is now live.

### Development Status
The current framework is stable and ready for the next phase of development.

- ‚úÖ SOCKS4 Proxy: Implemented and working.
- ‚û°Ô∏è SOCKS5 Proxy: The next immediate goal is to implement the full SOCKS5 handshake, including support for username/password authentication.
- üöÄ Protocol Translation Layer: The ultimate goal. This involves evolving the protocol handlers (IMAP, SMTP) from simple tunnels into intelligent translators that communicate with the comm.deadlight Cloudflare Worker via a secure HTTP API. This will require integrating an HTTP client library like libcurl.
- üïµÔ∏è Personal VPN-like Service: While a full VPN is out of scope, enhancing the SOCKS5 proxy provides a powerful, easy-to-use privacy feature for users, achieving the core goal of IP masking.
